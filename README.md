# d3.js Heat Map

#### Description: Heat map created with d3.js. Tools used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

I created a heat map using d3.js that displays the monthly global land surface temperature between the years 1753 - 2015. The year is on the x axis and the month is on the y axis. I designed it so that when you hover over a cell, it shows that cell's month, date, temperature, and variance in temperature. I also created a legend that shows the four different colors in the heat map that describe the variance in temperature.
